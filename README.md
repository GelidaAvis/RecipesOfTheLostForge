# Recipes of the Lost
Have you ever been in dire need of a saddle? Perhaps you absolutely needed sponges but weren't ready to face those dreaded Guardians or maybe you need item or XP but can't find any dungeons? Well luckily, Recipes of the Lost allows you to do just that! This mod will let players get their hands on uncraftable items, most recipes are easily available for the player to obtain, but the more special items require some more exploration and time. This mod also lets you craft two new special eggs that will help you craft creature spawn eggs! However, getting your hands on these new eggs will require a few resources. Each recipe is uniqure and makes sense regarding the different blocks, items and eggs; moreover, some require more or less extravagant items depending on the rarity or usefulness of that item, good luck and have fun crafting!
